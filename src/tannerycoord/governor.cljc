(ns tannerycoord.governor
  "TanneryCoordGovernor — the independent safety/scope layer gating
  every tannery scheduling/logistics proposal an advisor may make for
  a pelt-dressing/tanning/fellmongering crew. The governor never
  dispatches hardware itself, never performs tanning work itself, and
  never finalizes a tanning-execution decision (e.g. deciding to
  proceed with a specific pelt-tanning run) or a chemical-safety-
  clearance decision (e.g. declaring a tanned batch safe for handling
  or shipment), and never overrides a shop safety officer's judgment
  — those are permanently out of this actor's scope and remain a shop
  safety officer's exclusive judgment (README's 'Robotics premise':
  this actor coordinates TANNERY SCHEDULING/LOGISTICS ONLY — it never
  performs tanning work itself). Modeled closely on
  cloud-itonami-isco-7521's woodtreatcoord.governor.

  HARD invariants (:hard? true, ALWAYS :hold, never overridable):
    1. tanner provenance     — the crew member must be independently
                                verified/registered before any action.
    2. facility provenance   — the tannery site must be independently
                                verified/registered before any action.
    3. no-actuation           — proposal :effect must be :propose (the
                                governor never dispatches hardware and
                                never performs tanning work itself; it
                                only gates what the advisor may
                                coordinate).
    4. closed op-allowlist    — only :log-work-record,
                                :schedule-crew-operation,
                                :flag-safety-concern and
                                :coordinate-supply-order may ever be
                                proposed; anything else is refused.
    5. scope-excluded action  — any proposal to directly finalize a
                                tanning-execution decision (e.g.
                                deciding to proceed with a specific
                                pelt-tanning run), or a chemical-
                                safety-clearance decision (e.g.
                                declaring a tanned batch safe for
                                handling or shipment), or to override a
                                shop safety officer's judgment, is a
                                hard, permanent block (checked both
                                against the proposed :op and, defense-
                                in-depth, against the proposal's
                                :rationale text — matched as full
                                finalization/execution ACTION phrases
                                such as \"finalize the tanning
                                operation\" / \"declare the tannery
                                chemical-safety cleared\" / \"override
                                the shop safety officer's judgment\",
                                never as bare nouns like \"pelt\",
                                \"hide\", \"tanning\" or \"chromium\",
                                so the check can never self-trip on the
                                advisor's own routine rationale text,
                                e.g. \"logged work record for tanner
                                …\" or \"scheduled crew operation for
                                tannery task …\" or \"…routed for shop
                                safety officer review\" — all three
                                legitimately contain those bare nouns
                                but none is a finalization action, and
                                all are exercised by
                                `governor-test/default-mock-advisor-proposals-never-self-trip-on-scope-exclusion`).
  ESCALATION invariants (:escalate? true, ALWAYS human sign-off
  regardless of confidence):
    6. :op :flag-safety-concern (a chemical-exposure / ventilation /
                                equipment-condition concern always
                                escalates to a human, never auto-
                                commits).
    7. :op :coordinate-supply-order above `supply-cost-threshold`.
    8. low confidence (< `confidence-floor`).

  This actor coordinates tannery scheduling/logistics ONLY — it never
  performs tanning work itself, and it never makes a chemical-safety-
  clearance decision itself; those decisions always route to a human
  shop safety officer, either via a hard permanent block on the
  op-allowlist (rules 4/5 above) or via a mandatory escalation (rule 6
  above)."
